# Time by Time of Indonesia Vegetation

This repository contains a Python script that can be used to analyze changes in vegetation over time in Indonesia. The script takes in data on vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and generates visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps to help you identify patterns and trends in the data. The analysis is focused on Indonesia and covers a period of several years from 2000-2023. This tool can be especially useful for researchers and policymakers who want to better understand changes in vegetation in Indonesia over time and their potential impact on the environment and society.
